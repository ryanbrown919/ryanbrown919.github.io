                <h2 class="section-title">Project Background</h2>
                <p>
                    As part of integrated engineering, every year we form groups around an idea and complete a term long project. We have a lot of flexibility with what we attempt to do, as long as we can show a solid game plan and market value for our project.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my 3rd year, four of my peers and I decided to make a machine that can launch a volleyball in a similar fashion to the role played by a setter. 
                    This would allow users to practice offensive drills, arguably the most fun aspect of the sport, without requiring a setter to be present. The project was named Prospike, and with $400 and 6 months until presenting at Design and Innovation day 2023, we commenced.
                </p>
        
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Project Description</h2>
                <p>
                    There were many aspects of this project to consider, namely the aiming mechanism, launching mechanism, loading mechanism and the user interface.
                </p>
                <h4>Aiming</h4>
                <p> We prioritized the front row positions, so our design had a full range of motion along on axis of tilt. This was accomplidhed by a rotating frame built using alumnium extrusions and a linear actuator attached to one side of the frame.
                     The linear actuator was controlled by an arduino running a P-Control script, given input from an untrasonic sensor mounted to the linear actuator.
                </p>
                <h4>Launching</h4>
                <p>Luanching was accomplished through two 3D printed wheels independantly connected to two 24V electric motors. These motors are contorlled by a off-the-shelf PWM controller.
                    We modified this controller by replacing the dial potentiometer with an I2C digital potentiometer, allowing us to programmically contorl the speed of the motors based on the resistance specified.
                </p>
                <h4>Loading</h4>
                <p>To launch the ball, it was raised and pushed between the revolving wheels by a basket mounted to a waterjet cut rack, moved by a stepper rotating a spur gear. 
                    This enabled us to carefully lift the ball the exact right distance to force it between the wheels to launch. To reload a new ball, the basket was retunred to the bottom and a servo blocking balls from a small ramp moved out fo the way temporarily to allow a single ball to roll into the basket, ready to fire again.
                </p>
                <h4>User Interface</h4>
                <p>The user interface was powered by a HP Spectre computer set up in tablet orientation on a shelf on the machine. The interface was coded using C# and XAML, utilizing Windows Presentation Format and Visual Studio Blend to create an intuitive user interface. On the right side, several of the most common sets are listed as well as options for three custom sets, configurable in the settings page.
                    Custom sets allow the user to specify the apex height and final potiion of the ball, controlled by a vertical and horizontal slider.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can select up to 8 sets then activate the play button, after which the machine will run through the specified sequence of sets. The dispaly also features a custom made volleyball net graphic with a live visual of the ball and it's trajectory, including for the custom sets.

                <p>
                    This project was more complex than anything I have done before and was a massive group effort, that being said, I did contribute to many important aspects of the project.
    
                </p>
                <h4>Aiming</h4>
                <p>
                    Setting up the linear actuator and establishing the control was my contribution to the aiming mechanism. Due to our limited budget, the linear actuator we acquired did not contain potitional feedback. My solution to this was to use an ultrasonic sensor plentifully avalible for free mounted on the actuator body and a reference target mounted on the actuator arm to calculate the extension.
                    I also developed the arduino code which received a distance in centimeters from a central arduino through I2C and continously utilized P-control to reach the correct distance and say at that angle. 
                    PID-control was investigated, but the speed of the linear actuator limited the use of such a responsive system so it was not required.
                </p>
                <h4>Launching</h4>
                <p>
                    As I was heavily involved with system control, I implemented the replacement of manual control with a digital potentiomter. Also connected through I2C, 127 different resistance levels corresponded to different percentage powers and thus coould be used to control the trajecotry of the ball.
                </p>
                <h4>Loading</h4>
                <p>
                    Made from an acrylic sheet, I waterjet cut the rack and gear used for the loading mechansim forcing the ball between the launch wheels. I also developed the firmware for the timing of the reload servo synchronyzed with the basket being in the correct position.
                </p>
                <h4>User Interface</h4>
                <p>
                    The user interface was entirely developed by me. From creating the custom volleyball net graphic, to creating an encypted string to send to the microcontrollers with instructions for operation I worked full stack.
                    A lot of effort was put into making the user interface as intuitive as possible. As it was used via touch screen, pressing one of the presets changed the display to show that set with a trajectory displayed, and subsequent taps added that set to the sequence.
                    All of this coding was self-taught throughout this project as I had never used wither XAML or C# prior. Version control was also maintain via GitHub, which was essential as the computer used to run the program was not the same computer I developed the code on.

                <h4>Custom Sets & Live Trajectory Display</h4>
                <p>
                    I really wanted to display the trajectory of the ball. This could be done easily for the standard sets by drawing out all the options and changing the display when they get selected, but this would not work for the cutom sets.
                    I investigated many ways of doing this, and settled on creating a bezier curve. If you are unfamiliar with bezier curves, they are curves with a start and end point, as well as two control points. These control points can be used to make a parabolic shape with variable slope, perfect for displaying the trajectory of a ball.
    
                </p>
                <p>
                    By changing the control point's x and y positions according to the sliders, the drawing could be updated instantly. Additionally, by calculating the different between the start point and the first contol point, the slope of tangent line to launch could be calculated from the display itself. This allows the custom sets on the interface to actually 
                    translate to a calculated launch angle, and similarly the distance between control point and start point were used to calculate the required motor speed, found from baseline testing at set power levels.
