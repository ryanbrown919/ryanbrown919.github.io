This website is my portfolio, experimental playground and learning environement while I strengthen my software skills. I plan on making an elaborate website featuring professional and personal activity, as well as games, puzzles and other fun ways of demonstrating
who I am. Join me as I start HTML, CSS and Javascript essentially from scratch and learn coding best practices while I flesh out this site in the coming months
