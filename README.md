This website is my portfolio, experimental playground and learning environement while I strengthen my software skills. I plan on making a very elaborate website featuring professional and personal activity in my life, as well as games, puzzles and other fun ways of demonstrating
who I am. Join me as I start HTML, CSS and Javascript essentially from scratch and learn while I flesh out this site in the coming months
